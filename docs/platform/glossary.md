# Summary

There is certain terminology to be familiar with when operating the Klearwave application platform.  This 
serves as a centralized point for common terminology that you will come across:

* **Capability** - the foundation of any application platform.  This represents a capability that the 
application platform delivers for applications that run on that platform to consume.  In Klearwave, a 
capability is made up of a collection of components that are all tightly integrated with one another.

* **Component** - several components make up an individual application platform capability.  In the case 
of Klearwave, a component is equivalent to an upstream project.  Typically, several different components 
will make up a single capability.
